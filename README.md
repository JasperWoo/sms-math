# README

A sms-based question master, with questions meant to be designed by a central educational organization, and uses some kind of cryptocurrency that can motivate kids as rewards. 
Such cryptocurrency may have use in, for example, buying toys in real world. (This may only exist in utopia where everyone doesn't care about profit)
Question complexity increases over time. Required number of correctly answered questions to get rewards also increases, similar to how bitcoins operate.
Can be further implemented as a demo to instruct people about cryptocurrencies.(Sending messages about what hash gets generated, if the pattern matches or not)

Another possible usage of this application idea is to post extremely hard problem and give rewards like Cryptocurrencies.
The accepted answer must be verified by over 50% of the network.
With question being hashed to limit the rate one can answer questions, similar ideas to how bitcoins operate.
Can be further implemented to real-time multi-player question master. "Who answers first who win the round", just like miner.

## How to use

1. Send text via mobile's sms messenger 'register <name>' to '+1 678-916-9360'. (You would get error message if you don't register first)
2. Questions will be issued asynchronously depending on the hashing function.
3. Every time you receive a question, you should respond directly with your answer.
4. For example, with question "3+6=?", you should reply "9" directly.
5. After 5(currently hardcoded) times of answering correctly, you will get "rewards"(which hasn't be implemented yet lol).
6. You can test my app with multiple devices at the same time. I think it can scale with a couple more users :).
PS: Sorry for duplicate questions. I will keep adding new questions!
